Ever since I first took physics class in as freshman in high school, I’ve been fascinated by it. It provided exactness. It provided a set of rules of that when communicated through the language of mathematics, would give precise predictions of the future. Or, when interrogated thoughtfully, one can ask physics explain the past, from simple case of determining original height of a ball being dropped based on the rebound high, to the complex case of determining what does the beginning of the universe looks like. This ability to predict made physics beautiful to me. That’s why decided to study aerospace engineering in college. I dreamed of applying the elegant tool of physics and math to come up with something new and awesome.

Fast forward to the present, I’ve worked in the aerospace industry for about two years. From my experience in work at my company, I would say the current frontier to advance human technology is not longer just equations on paper. It’s an information organization problem. It’s how to use collect the right data, and use those data to make predictions and trends. It’s learning to deal with all that information that’s more than what we can process by hand. That’s why I’ve decided to learn Data Science. To be honest, I’m somewhat anxious, to stop relying on all these trusty equations to make decisions, and I’ll need to learn to be comfortable in using data that depends of statistics and probability. However, I’m still excited! it's always fun to gain a new skill!
